# Iris Dataset Clustering using K-Means
Simple unsupervised learning project for getting familiar with clustering using the Iris dataset and K-Means

### Summary 
- Visualised the correlation between features
- Used elbow method to find the ideal number of clusters
- Trained K-Means
- Confusion matrix indicates perfect mapping
- Silhouette score: ~0.44 (normal for Iris dataset as species overlap)

### Notes
- On the final plot we can see the clusters look good
- Dataset from Kaggle: Iris Species
